# California---The Sustainable Shrimp Initiative

Don Berger, founder of [Seadex, LLC,][0]has announced the creation of the "[Sustainable Shrimp Initiative (SSI)][1]", which promotes farmers whose practices emphasize excellence in all phases of shrimp production.

The SSI program will do for shrimp production what free-range chicken did for the poultry industry and what grass-fed beef did for the beef business.

Knowing that everything a shrimp farmer does affects flavor, the SSI program focuses on farming at the pond level.  The program has established a pond-to-fork supply chain that allows customers to know how their shrimp is produced. The program has shown that sustainable shrimp is better tasting shrimp.  In short, with sustainability comes enhanced taste and texture.

Seadex collaborates with the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch][2](r) program and is committed to sourcing shrimp rated as Green or Yellow by Seafood Watch for the Sustainable Shrimp Initiative.  The standards through which the Seafood Watch ratings are generated include attention to effluent, habitat, chemical use, feed use, disease outbreaks, production data and sources of farm stocks.

Shrimp from SSI farms will be marketed through a web-based platform established by [ShrimpTrader.com][3] and designed specifically for the Sustainable Shrimp Initiative.
