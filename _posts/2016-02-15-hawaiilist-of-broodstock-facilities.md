Hawaii is the world-renowned center for producing [specific pathogen-free (SPF) shrimp broodstock][0].  These animals are used to produce offspring in countries where shrimp diseases are a problem.  Currently, Hawaii SPF broodstock are exported to China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines.

The [Hawaii Shrimp Surveillance and Certification Program][1] is a voluntary program that is managed by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture.  Participating facilities undergo rigorous monitoring and must continuously test negative for specific pathogens for 24 months to receive SPF status.  Hawaii employs an aquaculture veterinary officer, Dr. Lei Yamasaki (contact information below), to monitor these facilities and to provide export documents.  The list of certificates required for exporting shrimp broodstock varies by importing country.  For information on the required documents for your country, [Click Here][2].
