The National Commission of Aquaculture and Fisheries, Mario Aguilar Sanchez, has said that from February 10 to Sunday March 27, about 300,000 tons of fishery and aquaculture products will be marketed.

The available species will have high nutritional value and be at affordable prices. Species such as tuna, sardines, squid, trout, tilapia, lebrancha and sea bass, as well as shellfish, will be sold.

Mr SÃ¡nchez confirmed that the supply of seafood is guaranteed for the whole country during the period of Lent and Easter 2016, when the demand for seafood rises.
