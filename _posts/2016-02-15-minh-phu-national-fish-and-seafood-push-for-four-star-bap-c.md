Vietnam's largest shrimp producer and exporter, will pursue four-star [Best Aquaculture Practices Certification][0] through a partnership with [National Fish and Seafood][1].

According to the [Global Aquaculture Alliance][2], approximately 800 Vietnamese shrimp farms will be encouraged to obtain BAP certification.  National Fish will assist producers with education, support and funding for farms to enroll in the [GAA's iBAP improvement program][3].

"This is a very important milestone for the BAP program," added Peter Redmond, BAP's Vice President of market development.  "We have long said that the traditional model of certifying a single farm is not practical for the future.  This announcement today further demonstrates our commitment to making third-party certification available to the majority of aquaculture constituents."

National Fish also pledged to market the shrimp from the farms that earn and retain BAP certification.  Likewise, GAA committed to providing the education and support necessary for National Fish and Seafood and Minh Phu to manage the project.

"We are delighted to announce our partnership with the GAA and Minh Phu on such a forward-thinking, innovative project to certify hundreds of small-scale shrimp farmers while preserving the sensitive, and extremely vulnerable, mangrove environment," said Jeff Sedacca, president of National Fish and Seafood's shrimp division.  "This initiative exemplifies a sustainable model which values environmental and social wellbeing and will provide ecological and economic returns for many years in the world's largest intact mangrove forest.  Third-party certification of this progressive farming model will open the doors to international markets, further incentivizing governments, private sector and NGOs to work together to strengthen sustainable aquaculture."
