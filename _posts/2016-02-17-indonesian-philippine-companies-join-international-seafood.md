# Indonesian, Philippine Companies Join International Seafood Sustainability Foundation ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b59dd311-8a04-4763-8fe4-60284b0f7030.jpg)

Indonesian company Avila Prima Intra Makmur and Philippine company Celebes Canning Corporation are the latest organizations to join the conservation efforts of the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) as participating companies.

Both companies join at the associate level. Participating companies work with the Foundation to advocate for improved fishery management, fund scientific advancements through research and expert analysis, and take direct action to encourage the adoption of responsible fishing practices.

"Our aim is to engage as many stakeholders as we can to improve the sustainability of the world's tuna resources effectively; adding two new companies from Southeast Asia means two more companies advocating for improved fishery management, helping to fund scientific research and making other direct actions aimed at improving the long-term health of tuna stocks," ISSF President Susan Jackson said.

"Avila Prima and Celebes are adding their names to a long list of ISSF participating companies implementing science-based conservation measures and commitments, and we are excited to watch their participation in the organization grow."

All ISSF Participating Companies are independently audited via comprehensive methods designed to assess compliance with each of ISSF's commitments and conservation measures, the results of which are shared via a company compliance report. The most recent audit results can be viewed here.

ISSF launched in 2009 with eight participating companies and today has 26 industry partners, which comprise more than 75 per cent of the world's processing capacity, including well-known brands produced and sold in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, the Pacific Islands and Asia.

Dongwon and SeaLord resigned as ISSF participating companies effective January 1, 2016\.
