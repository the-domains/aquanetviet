In this study, three groups of [monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)][0] specific to different [epitopes][1] on the [VP26 gene][2] were selected to detect natural WSSV infection in _Penaeus vannamei _using dot blotting, Western blotting or immunohistochemistry without cross-reaction with other shrimp tissues or other common shrimp viruses.   These VP26-specific MAbs could be used to confirm and to enhance the detection sensitivity for WSSV infection in shrimp with various types of antibody-based assays.
