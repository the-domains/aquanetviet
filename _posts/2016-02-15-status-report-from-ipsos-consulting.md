Domy Halim, Senior Consulting Manager at [Ipsos Business Consulting][0]in Indonesia, reports:

Indonesia's shrimp farming industry has the potential to become a global leader, thanks to its 81,000-kilometer coastline.  However, around 80% of our shrimp farmers, continue to rely on traditional extensive farming techniques.  Modernizing farming practice and improving logistics and infrastructure are critical requirements to further expand the industry.

• Around 20% of our shrimp farms are intensive.  Interestingly, in 2015, intensive farming accounted for 75% of the total shrimp production of around 350,000 metric tons, with typical harvests-per-hectare of 5-30 tons.  Most of the shrimp farms are extensive with stocking densities of 1-10/PLs/m2.  They only accounted for approximately 10% of production in 2015\.

• From 2011 to 2015, about 57% of our farmed shrimp was exported, a number that is expected to increase in the future.

• White feces disease (WFD) has reached epidemic proportions in major intensive shrimp farming regions, especially in Java and Lampung.  It has already forced farmers in the afflicted regions to adopt stocking densities 20 to 30% lower than optimal.
