            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shortage of Wild Juveniles for Stocking Lobster Farms</h1><p>Every year farmers in the central province of Khanh Hoa Khanh Hoa grow lobsters in more than 23,300 cages, accounting for more than 40 percent of the country’s total production, according to the province’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.  This year, however, fishermen have not been able to capture enough of the juvenile lobsters that are used to stock the cages.  Calm seas during the current lobster catching season have been blamed for the poor catches.  The season, from November to March, usually sees rough seas, causing juveniles to appear in large quantities.  There are no lobster hatcheries in Vietnam.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5a5d3b9fdd6529ab72ad660efccd7a1bddd639e5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
